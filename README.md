![This is an image](https://github.com/sanmeow/a1111-sd-zoe-depth/blob/main/sample.png)

**Introduce**  
This is only moving this demo to WEBUI tab  
https://huggingface.co/spaces/shariqfarooq/ZoeDepth  

For now it is the easist way to generate 3D inside WEBUI.  
You can print screen another angle, genarate new image with i2i.

**Update 2023/3/14**  
Made a Download button for glb file  
Console will show where it was saved at your local temp  
Try to free memory but cannot find where the VRAMs was taken,reduced a little, actually no OOM for me.  
Tried OBJ format, but no colors (sad  

Might work well with sd 3dmodel loader  
https://github.com/jtydhr88/sd-3dmodel-loader  
Until Trimesh have other color format go to 3D software,  
I think I will leave this "As is" for now, 
using it the "2D" way.  

Maybe try lot of gap inpaint and create a NERF from one image?  
Don't know will it work or not.  

I will try to improve it when I have time!
